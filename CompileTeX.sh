################################################################################
#
# Much like targets in a Makefile, this scripts provides functions to do a
# simple build, a full build, etc, for a LaTeX project.
#
# Three main functions, compile(), small_build(), and big_build():
#
# - compile() just runs the LaTeX compiler on whatever file it is given.
#
# - small_build() runs compile() on the regular copy, and then (if using
# \includeonly) on the unabridged copy. If \includeonly is not used, after
# compiling the regular copy, it just copies the pdf file---because in this
# case, both regular and unabridged versions match.
#
# - big_build() is the function supposed to be run when updating bibliographic
# references, indexes, etc. It is tricky to run when also using \includeonly;
# so it actually builds the entire document. See the comments therein for
# further information.
#
# Most of the remaining functions revolve around these three, to compile both
# the report and its unabridged version, and to check for errors and give
# feedback properly, and so on.
#
################################################################################

###

# Notes:
# - (1) After an unsuccessful compilation, and after fixing the mistake that
#   caused it, a normal compile, in batchmode with halt on errors, will still lead
#   to a natbib error. It goes away after doing another normal compile. But perhaps
#   the best strategy is to do debug mode in case of errors...
